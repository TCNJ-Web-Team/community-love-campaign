There’s this kind of magic that happens
when you perform with other people.

2
00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:11.052
And I think it happens all the time
here at TCNJ

3
00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:14.389
because the environment is so dedicated
toward student success.

4
00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% line:70% align:center
We are not a conservatory
or a conservatory-style university,

5
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:22.188
but our students perform
like conservatory students.

6
00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.273
I am always impressed

7
00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.526 position:50% line:70% align:center
by what our department is able to do
and the quality of programming,

8
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.529
the quality of teaching and learning,
and the quality of performance.

9
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.489
People see that
and people are hearing that,

10
00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.536
and so as our ensembles have grown,
as our enrollments have grown,

11
00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:41.166
it’s created some really great problems
that I'm excited for us to solve.

12
00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:45.754
During our last accreditation
visit in 2020, one of their charges to us

13
00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:50.300
was that we needed to address and find
a solution to our rehearsal spaces

14
00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.386
and to make certain
that we have facilities

15
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:57.515
that are both safe acoustically
and that meet the needs of our students.

16
00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.477
We used to have a designated
rehearsal space in the Music Building,

17
00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:04.689
but because our program is so large now,
that space is no longer safe to use

18
00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.942
because of how loud it is in there
when we all play together.

19
00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:13.239
So as a temporary fix, we’ve been bouncing
back and forth between Mayo Concert Hall

20
00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.785
and the main stage at Kendall,
but there’s often conflicts

21
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:20.872
with a lot of other campus activities.
Students need to move equipment

22
00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:26.211
from the Music Building to Kendall Hall
for every rehearsal and performance.

23
00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:30.131
And as we look ahead with this project
and the new building,

24
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:33.051
this is going to be,
you know, a point of pride for us.

25
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:35.220
I think one thing
that’s absolutely essential

26
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.599
to have when you’re making music
together is a designated shared space

27
00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:42.393
where we can say, this is our space,
this is our home,

28
00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:46.022
this is the place where we can come
sit down and make the magic happen.

29
00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.818
I certainly know it’s
going to take a team effort

30
00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:54.280
and it’s going to take the support
of our community, of our alumni,

31
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:58.368
of our friends
to bring this new facility to life.

32
00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.285
And so,

33
00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.788
I’m grateful for the number of people
I’ve met already

34
00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.749
who have bought into this,
who have invested in it.

35
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.086
I’m so excited by the prospect
that future students will get to rehearse

36
00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.003
in a space like this.
